Questions we’ll be asking of the data:
1.    Is there a correlation between software patents awarded within a given geographic region and increased economic activity?
a.    Does total patents awarded correlate with average income?
b.    Does total patents awarded correlate with auxiliary businesses (i.e. restaurants etc.)?
2.    Is there a relationship between the total number of patents filed in a given year and the total for a given region? i.e. does an environment of innovation beget more innovation.
